## Abstract

This proposal introduces two opcodes to support simple subroutines: `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`.

Taken together with other recent propoposals it provides an _efficient_, _static_, and _safe_ control-flow facility.

## Motivation

The EVM does not provide subroutines as primitives.

Instead, calls can be synthesized by fetching and pushing the return address and subroutine address on the data stack and executing a `JUMP` to the subroutine; returns can be synthesized by getting the return address to the top of the stack and jumping back to it.  These conventions cost gas and use stack slots unnecessarily.  And they create unnecessary complexity that is borne by the humans and programs writing, reading, and analyzing EVM code.

### Subroutines 

As an alternative, we propose to provide for subroutines with two simple operations:
* `RJUMPSUB` to call a subroutine and
* `RETURNSUB` to return from it.

Taken together with other required propoposals they provide an _efficient, static, complete, and safe_ control-flow facility.

_Efficient_.  Substantial reductions in the complexity and the gas costs of calling and optimizing simple subroutines -- as much as 56% savings in gas in the analysis below.  Substantial performance advantages for static jumps are [reported elsewhere](./eip-4200.md).

_Static_.  All possible jumps are known at contract creation time.

_Complete_.  Together with EIP-4200 it provides a minimal set of control structures for implementing programs -- jumps, conditional jumps, and subroutines.

_Safe_.  Valid programs will not halt with an exception unless they run out of gas or recursively overflow stack.

### Prior Art

Facilities to directly support subroutines are provided by all but one of the real and virtual machines we have programmed. This includes physical machines like the Burroughs 5000, CDC 7600, IBM 360, DEC PDP 11 and VAX, Motorola 68000, Sun SPARC, ARM, and a few generations of Intel x86; as well as virtual machines for Lisp, Pascal, Java, Wasm, and the sole exception -- the EVM.  The details and complexity vary, but in whatever form these facilities provide for
* capturing the current context of execution,
* transferring control to a new context, and 
* returning to the original context
   * after possible further transfers of control
   * to some arbitrary depth.

Over the years, for the machines we have programmed, native subroutine operations have proven their value for efficient implementation and simple coding of subroutines.

#### Original Design

The [first specification](https://academic.oupnne.com/comjnl/article/20/3/269/751954) of subroutines for a real machine goes back to [Turing's Automatic Computing Engine of 1946](http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/p/p01/P01-001.html):
> We also wish to be able to arrange for the splitting up of operations into subsidiary operations.  This should be done in such a way that once we have written down how an operation is done we can use it as a subsidiary to any other operation.
>  ... 
> When we wish to start on a subsidiary operation we need only make a note of where we left off the major operation and then apply the first instruction of the subsidiary.  When the subsidiary is over we look up the note [on] a list of these notes in one or more standard size delay lines, (1024) with the most recent last.

Turings's machine held data in delay lines made of mercury-filled crystals.  We have better hardware now, but the concept is simple and by now familiar.  In less archaic language, Turing's full specification is that:
* The "subsidiary operations" are subroutines.
* The "list of notes" is a stack of return addresses.
* When a subroutine is called
  * the current program address is pushed on the stack, and
  * control transfers to "apply the first instruction of the subsidiary" at the subroutine address.
* When a subroutine returns
  * the return address is popped off of the stack and
  * control transfers to the instruction at the return address.

This design still sees use by virtual machines for Lisp, Forth, Java, Wasm and others.

## Specification

We propose to follow Turing's original specification, as applied to the EVM architecture.  We support calls and returns with a `return stack` of return addresses. The EVM`return stack`, like the EVM `data stack`, is limited to `1024` items. This `return stack` is accessed via two new subroutine instructions.

### Instructions

#### `RJUMPSUB (0x5e) jmpdest`

> Transfers control to a subroutine.  The destination address is relative to the current PC. 
>
> * Decode the `jmpdest` from the immediate data.
>    * The data is encoded as a two-byte, twos-complement signed integer, stored MSB-first.
> * Push `PC + 1` on the `return stack`.
> * Set `PC` to `PC + jmpdest`.

The cost is _low_.

#### `RETURNSUB (0x5f)`

> Returns control to the caller of a subroutine.
> 
> *  Pop `PC` off the `return stack`.
>
> The cost is _verylow_.

_Notes:_
* _If a resulting `PC` to be executed is beyond the last instruction then the opcode is implicitly a `STOP`, which is not an error._
* _Values popped off the `return stack` do not need to be validated, since they are alterable only by `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`._ 
* _The description above lays out the semantics of these instructions in terms of a `return stack`.  But the actual state of the `return stack` is not observable by EVM code or consensus-critical to the protocol.  (For example, a node implementer may code `RJUMPSUB` to unobservably push `PC` on the `return stack` rather than `PC + 1`, which is allowed so long as `RETURNSUB` observably returns control to the `PC + 1` location.)_
* _The `return stack` is the functional equivalent of Turing's "delay line"._

The _low_ cost of `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` is justified by needing only to add the immediate two byte destination to the `PC` and push the return address on the `return stack`, all using native arithmetric, versus using the data stack with emulated 256-bit instructions.

The _verylow_ cost of `RETURNSUB` is justified by needing only to pop the `return stack` into the `PC`.  Benchmarking will be needed to tell if the costs are well-balanced.

### Safety

We define safety here as avoiding exceptional halting states, as defined in the Yellow Paper.  A validator can always detect three of these states at _validation time_:
* Insufficient stack items
* Invalid jump destination
* Invalid instruction

A validator can detect stack overflow only for non-recursive programs, so two states will still require tests at _runtime_:
* Stack overflow
* Insufficient gas 

[EIP-3779: Safer Control Flow for the EVM](./eip-3779.md) specifies initialization-time validation to detect invalid contracts.

## Rationale

Below we explore the advantages of have a subroutines as primitives, design alternatives, and the reasons for our choice of specification.

### Efficiency Analysis

We show here how subroutine instructions can be used to reduce the complexity and gas costs of both ordinary and optimized subroutine calls compared to using `JUMP`.

#### **Simple Subroutine Call**

Consider this example of calling a fairly minimal subroutine.

Subroutine call, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    RTN_SQUARE      ; 3 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
RTN_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 50 gas_

Subroutine call, using `RJUMPSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    rjumpsub SQUARE ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
_Total 22 gas._

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _50 - 22 = 28 gas_ -- a _56%_ improvement.

#### **Tail Call Optimization**

Of course in cases like this one we can optimize the tail call, so that the return from `SQUARE` actually returns from `TEST_SQUARE`.

Tail call optimization, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 33 gas_

Tail call optimization, using `RJUMP` and `RETURNSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    rjump SQUARE    ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```

_Total: 17 gas_

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _33 - 17 = 16_ gas -- a _48%_ improvement.

####  **Call Using Data Stack**

We can also consider an alternative call mechanism -- call it `DATASUB` -- that pushes its return address on the `data_stack`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    datasub SQUARE  ; 6 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```

_Total 26 gas._

Using `DATASUB` versus `JUMP` saves _50 - 26 = 24 gas_ -- a _48%_ improvement.

By comparison, the `RJUMPSUB` version saves _28 gas_ -- a _56%_ improvement.

_Note: The gas cost for `DATASUB` is 6 here versus 5 for `RJUMPSUB` because using the wide-integer `data_stack` is less efficient than using a stack of native integers._

#### Conlusion

We can see that these instructions provide a simpler and more gas-efficient subroutine mechanism than using `JUMP`.

Clearly, the benefits of these efficiencies are greater for programs that have been factored into smaller subroutines, but a routine could use _200 more gas_ than our first example and `RJUMPSUB` would still use better than _10% less gas_ than `JUMP`.

_Note:  A _stack rotation_ operator to move items on the stack and implicitly shift the intervening items could simplify code using `JUMP`. It would be a potentionally expensive operation with a dynamic gas cost._

### Design Alternatives

There are at least two designs for a subroutine facility.

**Turing's design** keeps return addresses on a dedicated stack.

As specified above, the instruction to call a subroutine will
* Push the return address onto the return address stack.
* Jump to the first instruction of the subroutine.

And the instruction to return from a subroutine will
* Jump to the address popped off of the return address stack.

We have chosen Turing's design, as have Forth, Java, Wasm, and others.  On a stack machine almost all computation is done on the stack, and on these machines the return information is not conveniently 

For these machines, an advantage of keeping a separate return stack is that it leaves to the implementation the representation of the data stack, which can remain opaque to the user.  All that matters is that calls and returns work.

**An alternative design** is to keep return addresses on the `data stack`. 

The instruction to call a subroutine will:
* Push the return address onto the `data stack`.
* Jump to the first instruction of the subroutine.

The instruction to return from a subroutine will:
* _Ensure that the return address is the first element on the stack._
* Jump to the address popped off of the `data stack`.

This design became popular on silicon in the 1970's and remains so.  Examples include the PDP 11, VAX, M68000, SPARC, and x86.  These are all register machines, not stack machines.  The registers are used for computation, and the stack is used by subroutine calls for return addresses and call frames.

For all of these machines instruction addresses fit efficiently into machine words on the `data stack`.

We give an example of this alternative design above.

**We prefer** Turing's design for a few reasons.
* It maintains a clear separation between calculation and flow of control: the data stack is uncluttered with vulnerable return addresses and it's impossible to overwrite the return stack.
* It improves efficiency by
  * using native arithmetic rather than 256-bit EVM instructions for the return address,
  * not using a `data stack` slot for the return address,
  * and not imposing a need to swap items around return addresses and return addresses around items.
* It has a 76-year history of success, especially on stack machines.

Keeping code simple is good.  And keeping control flow opaque has clear safety advantages -- the state of the VM -- the stack, frame, and instruction pointers -- is not made visible or mutable as data.  

Finally, given that the EVM is a stack machine with very wide words, the performance advantages and the decades of successful use of Turing's design by similar machines weighed heavily in our decision.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code: bytes that would have been interpreted as valid jump destinations may now be interpreted as immediate data.  Since this proposal depends on the Ethereum Object Format to signal the change this is not a practical issue. 

## Test Cases

### Simple routine

This should jump into a subroutine, back out and stop.

Bytecode: `0x60045e005b5d` (`PUSH1 0x04, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Output: 0x
Consumed gas: `10`

### Two levels of subroutines

This should execute fine, going into one two depths of subroutines

Bytecode: `0x
00000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d` (`PUSH9 0x00000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |     [0,3] |
|    5  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [3] |
|    6  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `20`

### Failure 1: invalid jump

This should fail, since the given location is outside of the code-range. The code is the same as previous example, 
except that the pushed location is `0x01000000000000000c` instead of `0x0c`.

Bytecode: (`PUSH9 0x01000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, `0x6801000000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d`, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |   10 |[18446744073709551628] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=10, op=JUMPSUB: invalid jump destination
```

### Failure 2: shallow `return stack`

This should fail at first opcode, due to shallow `return_stack`

Bytecode: `0x5d5858` (`RETURNSUB, PC, PC`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=0, op=RETURNSUB: invalid retsub
```

### Subroutine at end of code

In this example. the JUMPSUB is on the last byte of code. When the subroutine returns, it should hit the 'virtual stop' _after_ the bytecode, and not exit with error

Bytecode: `0x6005565b5d5b60035e` (`PUSH1 0x05, JUMP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x03, JUMPSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |      PUSH1  |    3 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |       JUMP  |    8 |       [5] |        [] |
|    5  |   JUMPDEST  |    1 |        [] |        [] |
|    6  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [2] |
|    7  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `30`

## Security Considerations

These changes introduce new flow control instructions.  They do not introduce any new security considerations. In concert with [EIP-3779: Safer Control Flow for the EVM](./eip-3779.md) they will increase security by providing for validated control flow.
