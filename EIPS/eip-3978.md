## Abstract

Revering whole transaction or it subcall mean ignoring state modifications happened in the reverted entity. But gas refund on revert will not be increased, it will even be completely erased.

Since [EIP-3298](./eip-3298.md) gas refund mechanism works for storage restores only inside the same transaction. For example [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) `approve` + `transferFrom` flow between 2 smart contracts according to [EIP-2200](./eip-2200.md) and [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) will cost nearly to `21600` gas with gas refund counter `20000`. But in case of reverting this subcall (containing both `approve` and `transferForm`) gas refund will be erased, while smart contract storage will remain unmodified. This leads users to pay for storage non-modification as for storage modification. I think it should keep "access" costs and refund difference to modification costs.
 
It makes sense to have gas refund for different reverted operations:
- Reverted SSTORE deserves to be repriced to SLOAD gas
- Reverted LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3 and LOG4 deserve to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CALL with value (`positive_value_cost` = 9,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CALL with value and account creation (`value_to_empty_account_cost` = 25,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CREATE and CREATE2 (32,000 gas) deserve to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted SELFDESTRUCT (5,000 or 25,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas

Moreover it seems fair to charge CREATE and CREATE2 operations 32,000 fix price conditionally only if returned bytecode is not empty.

## Motivation

Blockhain users pay for storage non-modification as for storage modification - this seems unfair.

## Specification

Let's accumulate (SSTORE_price - SLOADprice) for every SSTORE for every call and set refund gas counter to this accumutated value on revert instead of erasing it as it happends now. Let's consider reverted LOG price to be 100 gas.
```
if (call.reverted) {
    // existing behavior
    tx.gas_refund -= call.gas_refund_counter;
    
    // New behavior added to existing according to EIP-3978
    tx.gas_refund += call.sstores_sloads_diff_counter;
    tx.gas_refund += (call.log_gas_counter - call.events.length * 100);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_positive_value_cost * 89 / 90);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_value_to_empty_account_cost * 249 / 250);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_create_and_create2_cost * 319 / 320);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_selfdestruct_to_existing_account_cost * 249 / 250);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_selfdestruct_to_new_account_cost * 49 / 50);
}
```
